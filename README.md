#  CatalystMenuCustomViews

This Mac Catalyst example showcases a way to embed custom views, built with AppKit, in a UIKit-presented menu tree.

- From a pull-down button
- In a context menu
- In a menu bar menu

This example swizzles private API and should be treated with oven mitts until a fitting public replacement is available.
